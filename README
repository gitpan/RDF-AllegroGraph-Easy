RDF-AllegroGraph-Easy
=====================

WHAT IS IT
----------

This is an API which communicates with the AllegroGraph HTTP server

  version 3: http://agraph.franz.com/support/documentation/3.2/new-http-server.html
  version 4: http://www.franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/v4/http-protocol.html

That server offers Sesame-like functionality of an RDF tuple store.

The Perl interface has been tested against:

   AG fse 3.3
   AG 4.2

STATUS
------

This is still an exploratory version. Nothing has been done to make this scale in terms of
size/speed. While there is much AG4 support, it is not complete. See the ROADMAP for ideas
how this package will evolve.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

Dependencies can be resolved via CPAN, or in Debian/Ubuntu via

   apt-get install libjson-perl liburi-perl libtest-exception-perl libwww-perl libpod-coverage-perl libregexp-common-perl 

TESTING
-------

By default the test suite will be skipped. To test this package against a
live v3 server set the AG3_SERVER environment variable on a shell:

  export AG3_SERVER=http://localhost:8080

If you have started your AllegroGraph server with a username/password, you
should add it in the URL:

  export AG3_SERVER=http://myuser:mypass@localhost:8080

For a version 4 server use the environment variable AG4_SERVER:

  export AG4_SERVER=http://myuser:mypass@localhost:10035

In BOTH cases the test suites expect a 'scratch' catalog on the server already created. Look at the
AG server documentation how to configure catalogs.

Then run again

  ./Build test
