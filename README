RDF-AllegroGraph-Easy
=====================

WHAT IS IT
----------

This an API which communicates with the AllegroGraph HTTP server

  http://agraph.franz.com/support/documentation/3.2/new-http-server.html

That server offers Sesame like functionality of an RDF tuple store.

STATUS
------

This is an experimental version. Nothing has been done to make this
scale in terms of size/speed. Also only a fraction of the AllegroGraph
server functionality is covered yet.

TESTING
-------

By default the test suite will be skipped. To test this package against a
live server set the AG_SERVER environment variable on a shell:

  export AG_SERVER=http://localhost:8080

If you have started your AllegroGraph server with a username/password, you
should add it in the URL:

  export AG_SERVER=http://myuser:mypass@localhost:8080

Then run again

  ./Build test

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build

Dependencies can be resolved via CPAN, or in Debian
