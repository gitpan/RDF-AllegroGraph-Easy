=head1 NAME

RDF::AllegroGraph::Easy - Simplistic Interface to AllegroGraph HTTP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $storage = new RDF::AllegroGraph::Easy ('http://my:secret@localhost:10035');
  my $model   = $storage->model ('/scratch/catlitter', mode => O_CREAT);

  $model->add (....);                            # add stuff
  $model->delete (...);                          # get rid of stuff
  my @tuples = $model->sparql ('SELECT ...');    # query it
  $model->disband;                               # remove the whole thing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The idea of this interface is to concentrate on the essentials:

=over

=item *

how to get a handle to a remote tuple store (see L<RDF::AllegroGraph::Server> for details)

=item *

how to get RDF content into that model (see L<RDF::AllegroGraph::Repository> for details)

=item *

how to query the model (see L<RDF::AllegroGraph::Repository> for details)

=back

Currently this abstraction layer supports v3 and v4 AG server, albeit with many omissions.

=head2 Constructor

[changed v0.6]

The constructor expects one parameter which is interpreted as HTTP endpoint for your AllegroGraph
server. If left C<undef>, then the default C<http://localhost:10035> will be used.

B<NOTE>: No trailing slash!
