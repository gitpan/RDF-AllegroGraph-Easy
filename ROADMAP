This Perl API to the AG3/4 servers has been so far a free-time
activity for me. Consequently - apart from the proof of concept at the
beginning - I have little incentives to really push on to get a soso
feature-complete onto the road. Most satisfaction I get from offering
a more-or-less elegant API to the Perl user, hiding some
idiosynchrasies of the AG server. That is, I believe in the casual
user :-)

Still, with a bit of nudging I do invest on/off timeslots to make
inroads into the AGv4 protocol (see the Changes file for tracking).

That said, I am open to suggestions to speed up the process of feature
coverage and/or think more about performance when using AG with Perl
for large data sets.

Overall Roadmap:

   - feature completeness sometime in Q1'11
   - performance tuning (memory usage, speed, round tripping) Q2'11
     and Q3'11
